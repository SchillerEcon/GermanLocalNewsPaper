# GermanLocalNewsPaper

This projects aims to examine the language complexity within German local newspapers. I am an economics researcher and PhD candidate from Leibniz University Hannover, with a focus on political economy.

The central thesis of our project so far is that the ability to understand and express complex language is an important skill in politics and the lack therof leads to disenfranchisment. With distrust in traditional media at alltime highs, we want to test whether complex language used by newspapers leads to alienation from the political proccess as well as populist voting patterns. The complexity levels of newspapers are too high to be fully understood by the majority of citizens in Germany and USA according to previous research, and might also be associated with elitism.

For one of our identification strategies, we require a local measure of language complexity, which can be achieved by measuring the language complexity of local newspapers. 

I can share preliminary drafts on request.
